## Development

### Registry Sync

This project uses Storybook as the source of truth for components. To keep the CLI registry in sync with Storybook components:

```sh
# Sync all components from Storybook to registry
npx tsx scripts/sync-registry.ts

# Preview changes without modifying files (dry run)
npx tsx scripts/sync-registry.ts --dry-run

# Sync a specific component
npx tsx scripts/sync-registry.ts --component Button

# Test the sync functionality
npx tsx scripts/test-sync.ts
```

**When to sync:**
- After updating components in Storybook
- Before publishing a new version
- When adding new components

The sync script will:
- âœ… Extract components from `apps/storybook/components/`
- âœ… Update dependency metadata (only `@rn-primitives/*` packages)
- âœ… Convert import paths to `@/components/ui/[component]`
- âœ… Preserve existing ICON_PATHS
- âœ… Create automatic backups
- âœ… Generate clean, consistent component templates
